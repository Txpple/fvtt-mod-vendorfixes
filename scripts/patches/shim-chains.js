/**
 * VF-001 · SHIM CHAINS — an effect written against an old dnd5e key reaches the field it was moved to,
 * however many times it moved.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM (Session 8, 2026-09-22 — Jetten's Roving never raised his speed): dnd5e 6.0 keeps
 * a table of moved effect keys, `ActiveEffect5e.SHIM_FIELDS`, and `_applyChangeShim` rewrites a
 * change's key through it ONCE. Some keys moved twice and the table records each move on its
 * own: `system.attributes.movement.speed` → `system.attributes.movement.walk`, and
 * `…movement.walk` → `…movement.speeds.walk`. One hop leaves the change on `movement.walk`,
 * which is no longer a number field — measured on 6.0.3 against the PHB's own Roving (a
 * premium pack not yet written for 6.0: `movement.speed` +10, climb and swim `=
 * @attributes.movement.speed`) on a 35-foot ranger: a walking speed of **3510** (the +10 glued
 * on as text) and climb and swim to match. The same item with the chain followed: 45, 45, 45 —
 * the rule exactly.
 *
 * THE FIX: at `setup`, before any actor prepares, every shim whose target is itself shimmed is
 * pointed at the END of its chain. Nothing else about the entry changes (its `type`, `value`
 * and deprecation `warning` stay the first hop's), a single-hop entry is untouched, and a cycle
 * stops where it closes. The pack's data is never edited — every copy of every item with an
 * old key is fixed at once, including the next ranger's Roving.
